# QuakeC GPL

Quake game code (progs.dat) with bug fixes released under the GPL.

## About

The Quake computer game Quake was released in 1996.

In 1999 the source code for the Quake engine (.exe), tools (qcc), and game code (progs.dat) was released under the GPL.

The version of the Quake game code released under the GPL was v1.01, different from the latest release of the game code v1.06.

This project provides a version of the Quake game code v1.01 released under the GPL updated with a "clean room" implementation of fixes in the v1.06 code.

This project also includes a host of other bug fixes such as compiler warnings, removal of unused code, and reported bugs.

## Features

* Released under the permissive GNU GPL license.
* Based on Quake game code v1.01 released under the GPL.
* Supports all changes in the Quake game code v1.06.
* One change per commit to provide traceability of changes.
* Fixed compiler warnings for bad function definitions and uninitialized variables.
* Removed unused files and unused local and global variables.

## How to Use

You can use this game code to **play quake** with bugs fixed, or as the basis for **mod development**.

### Play Quake

You can use the game code (`progs.dat`) to play Quake, such as singleplayer or multiplayer.

1. Download the .zip file for the latest release.
2. Unzip and locate the `progs.dat` file.
3. Create a mod subdirectory under your quake directory, e.g. `quakegpl/`
4. Place the `progs.dat` into your mod subdirectory, e.g. `quakegpl/progs.dat`
5. Start quake and load the mod, e.g. `quake -game quakegpl`

### Mod Development

You can use the .qc files as the basis for mod development.

1. Download the .zip file for the latest release.
2. Unzip and locate the `progs.dat` file.
3. Access the source code in the `qc/` subdirectory.
